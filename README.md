# Scotchy - React UI

I starting learning web development around the same time I took up scotch as a hobby.  Worlds colided and "Scotchy" is the result.  Scotchy is a web application that can be used by scotch whisky enthusiasts to document information related to their hobby.

Scotchy is architected to be very modular to allow explorations into different back end technologies (e.g. Node/Express/Mongo, .NET, LAMP, etc.) as well as front end technologies (Angular, React, Vue, .NET, etc.) The end result is we'll be able to build any number of Scotchy "stacks" by mixing and matching backend API's with frontend UI's.

This repository represents the second of the UI modules and is written using React and Redux.

Additional details can be found in the [Scotchy Angular UI Wiki](https://github.com/a951racer/Scotchy-Angular-UI/wiki):
